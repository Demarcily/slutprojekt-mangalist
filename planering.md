# Manga List
The plan is to make a site where you can create a user, log in, and create a manga list that is connected to your user only.

## Routes
:/

:/account (Sign up and log in) (bytte till :/users istället)

:/mangalist (Need a log in)

## CRUD
Create and Remove manga, edit the current chapter, get mangalist connected to specific user.

## Database
users - Store all logins.

manga - Store manga entries, somehow connected to their respective user, either on this database or through the other one.

## Frontend
Home page - no real content.

Sign up and log in - a form to send data to users.

Mangalist page - list of all manga the user is currently reading.

## Backend
NJK.

## Avgränsningar
Learn more about login.

Figure out how to connect mangalist to specific user, maybe have the entries connected to the user, however that will create a lot of dupilicates the more users there are.
